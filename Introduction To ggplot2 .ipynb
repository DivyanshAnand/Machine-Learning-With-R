    "## Introduction To ggplot2 (Full R code)\n",
    "Previously we saw a brief tutorial of making charts with ggplot2 package. It quickly touched upon the various aspects of making ggplot. Now, this is a complete and full fledged tutorial. I start from scratch and discuss how to construct and customize almost any ggplot. It goes into the principles, steps and nuances of making the plots effective and more visually appealing. So, for practical purposes I hope this tutorial serves well as a bookmark reference that will be useful for your day-to-day plotmaking.\n",

    "This is part 1 of a three part tutorial on ggplot2, an aesthetically pleasing (and very popular) graphics framework in R. This tutorial is primarily geared towards those having some basic knowledge of the R programming language and want to make complex and nice looking charts with R ggplot2.\n",

    "Part 1: Introduction to ggplot2, covers the basic knowledge about constructing simple ggplots and modifying the components and aesthetics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Part 2: Customizing the Look and Feel, is about more advanced customization like manipulating legend, annotations, multiplots with faceting and custom layouts\n",
    "\n",

    "1. Understanding the Ggplot Syntax\n",
    "The syntax for constructing ggplots could be puzzling if you are a beginner or work primarily with base graphics. The main difference is that, unlike base graphics, ggplot works with dataframes and not individual vectors. All the data needed to make the plot is typically be contained within the dataframe supplied to the ggplot() itself or can be supplied to respective geoms. More on that later.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second noticeable feature is that you can keep enhancing the plot by adding more layers (and themes) to an existing plot created using the ggplot() function.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s initialize a basic ggplot based on the midwest dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Setup\n",
    "options(scipen=999)  # turn off scientific notation like 1e+06\n",
    "library(ggplot2)\n",
    "data(\"midwest\", package = \"ggplot2\")  # load the data\n",
    "# midwest <- read.csv(\"http://goo.gl/G1K41K\") # alt source \n",

    "# Init Ggplot\n",
    "ggplot(midwest, aes(x=area, y=poptotal))  # area and poptotal are columns in 'midwest'\n",
    "Ggplot Canvas\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A blank ggplot is drawn. Even though the x and y are specified, there are no points or lines in it. This is because, ggplot doesn’t assume that you meant a scatterplot or a line chart to be drawn. I have only told ggplot what dataset to use and what columns should be used for X and Y axis. I haven’t explicitly asked it to draw any points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also note that aes() function is used to specify the X and Y axes. That’s because, any information that is part of the source dataframe has to be specified inside the aes() function.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. How to Make a Simple Scatterplot\n",
    "Let’s make a scatterplot on top of the blank ggplot by adding points using a geom layer called geom_point.\n",
    "\n",
    "library(ggplot2)\n",
    "ggplot(midwest, aes(x=area, y=poptotal)) + geom_point()\n",
    "Ggplot Scatterplot\n",
    "\n",
    "We got a basic scatterplot, where each point represents a county. However, it lacks some basic components such as the plot title, meaningful axis labels etc. Moreover most of the points are concentrated on the bottom portion of the plot, which is not so nice. You will see how to rectify these in upcoming steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like geom_point(), there are many such geom layers which we will see in a subsequent part in this tutorial series. For now, let’s just add a smoothing layer using geom_smooth(method='lm'). Since the method is set as lm (short for linear model), it draws the line of best fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "library(ggplot2)\n",
    "g <- ggplot(midwest, aes(x=area, y=poptotal)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method=\"lm\")  # set se=FALSE to turnoff confidence bands\n",
    "plot(g)\n",
    "Ggplot Scatterplot\n",
    "\n",
    "The line of best fit is in blue. Can you find out what other method options are available for geom_smooth? (note: see ?geom_smooth). You might have noticed that majority of points lie in the bottom of the chart which doesn’t really look nice. So, let’s change the Y-axis limits to focus on the lower half.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Adjusting the X and Y axis limits\n",
    "The X and Y axis limits can be controlled in 2 ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "Method 1: By deleting the points outside the range\n",
    "This will change the lines of best fit or smoothing lines as compared to the original data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be done by xlim() and ylim(). You can pass a numeric vector of length 2 (with max and min values) or just the max and min values itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "library(ggplot2)\n",
    "g <- ggplot(midwest, aes(x=area, y=poptotal)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method=\"lm\")  # set se=FALSE to turnoff confidence bands\n",
    "\n",
    "# Delete the points outside the limits\n",
    "g + xlim(c(0, 0.1)) + ylim(c(0, 1000000))   # deletes points\n",
    "# g + xlim(0, 0.1) + ylim(0, 1000000)   # deletes points\n",
    "Ggplot Scatterplot\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the chart was not built from scratch but rather was built on top of g. This is because, the previous plot was stored as g, a ggplot object, which when called will reproduce the original plot. Using ggplot, you can add more layers, themes and other settings on top of this plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Did you notice that the line of best fit became more horizontal compared to the original plot? This is because, when using xlim() and ylim(), the points outside the specified range are deleted and will not be considered while drawing the line of best fit (using geom_smooth(method='lm')). This feature might come in handy when you wish to know how the line of best fit would change when some extreme values (or outliers) are removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Method 2: Zooming In\n",
    "The other method is to change the X and Y axis limits by zooming in to the region of interest without deleting the points. This is done using coord_cartesian().\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s store this plot as g1.\n",
    "\n",
    "library(ggplot2)\n",
    "g <- ggplot(midwest, aes(x=area, y=poptotal)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method=\"lm\")  # set se=FALSE to turnoff confidence bands\n",
    "\n",
    "# Zoom in without deleting the points outside the limits. \n",
    "# As a result, the line of best fit is the same as the original plot.\n",
    "g1 <- g + coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,0.1), ylim=c(0, 1000000))  # zooms in\n",
    "plot(g1)\n",
    "Ggplot Scatterplot\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Since all points were considered, the line of best fit did not change.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. How to Change the Title and Axis Labels\n",
    "I have stored this as g1. Let’s add the plot title and labels for X and Y axis. This can be done in one go using the labs() function with title, x and y arguments. Another option is to use the ggtitle(), xlab() and ylab().\n",
    "\n",
    "library(ggplot2)\n",
    "g <- ggplot(midwest, aes(x=area, y=poptotal)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method=\"lm\")  # set se=FALSE to turnoff confidence bands\n",
