# Machine-Learning-With-R and Statistical Learning: with Applications in R
 1. Learn the basics of prediction using machine learning. This track covers predicting categorical and numeric responses via classification and regression, and discovering the hidden structure of datasets (unsupervised learning). Learn how to process data for modeling, how to train your models, how to visualize your models and assess their performance, and how to tune their parameters for better performance.
 2. Statistical Learning provides an accessible overview of the field of statistical learning, an essential toolset for making sense of the vast and complex data sets that have emerged in fields ranging from biology to finance to marketing to astrophysics in the past twenty years. This book presents some of the most important modeling and prediction techniques, along with relevant applications. Topics include linear regression, classification, resampling methods, shrinkage approaches, tree-based methods, support vector machines, clustering, and more. Color graphics and real-world examples are used to illustrate the methods presented. Since the goal of this textbook is to facilitate the use of these statistical learning techniques by practitioners in science, industry, and other fields, each chapter contains a tutorial on implementing the analyses and methods presented in R, an extremely popular open source statistical software platform.
